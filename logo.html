                        The logo for our refugee app Borderless combines two of our original designs: one depicts two people inside a globe, and the other shows the globe under the roof of a house. 
                        The first design signifies the idea of a global community that transcends national borders and brings people from all walks of life together in a shared space. 
                        This is particularly relevant for a refugee app, which aims to connect displaced individuals with resources and support networks across different countries and regions.
                         The second design, with the globe under the roof of a house, conveys a sense of safety, security, and belonging. It suggests that, despite their displacement, 
                         refugees can find a new home and a sense of place in their new location. Overall, the logo for Borderless is a powerful symbol of hope and solidarity, we wanted to keep it simple
                         with minimal detail allowing people to intepret it in different ways. This logo represents the app's mission to break down barriers and build bridges between people from all corners of the world.
